A stupid udev mass copier for conference USB keys.

Copy the script where you want it.
Copy the udev rule in /etc/udev/rules.d (or whereever your distribution puts udev rules). Don't forget to change where the script is and the vendor and product id (lsusb will tell you that)

This is probably completely insecure and can cause a big mess, at least it worked as a quick and dirty hack for my use. Also it runs as root by default, and I'm not responsible for anything that could happen.
